# WIP Bevy workshop

This workshop is made primarily as a tool for preparing people for an internal game jam.
It is not meant to be a comprehensive guide to everything Bevy!

The version of Bevy this is made for is 17.x. 
I may update it for later releases, but then again, I may not.

## The presentation

You will need `mdbook` installed, you can do this using cargo:

```shell
cargo install mdbook
```

Now all you need to do at the root of the repository is:

```shell
mdbook serve --open
```
